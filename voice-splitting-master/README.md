# Voice Splitting
The goal of this project is to have a Java program which is able to split MIDI performance
data into monophonic voices.

Note that some MIDI files separate voices by channel, while some
do so by track. This project uses channel by default, but this can be changed by using the
`-T` flag when running from the command line, or by unchecking the `Use Channel` box (and
then reloading the file) if using the GUI. MIDI files written out by this software will have
voices divided by both channel and track.

## License
You are free to use this software as is allowed by the [MIT License](https://github.com/apmcleod/voice-splitting/blob/master/License).
I only ask that you please cite it as my work where appropriate, including
the paper on my [website](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1331854/software.html#VoiceSeparation)
which has been published in the Journal of New Music Research.

## Documentation
This document contains some basic code examples and a general overview of how to use
the classes in this project. All specific documentation for the code found in this
project can be found in the [Javadocs](https://apmcleod.github.io/voice-splitting/doc).

An in-depth walkthrough of how to use the GUI can be found in the [GUI Readme](http://apmcleod.github.io/voice-splitting/gui.html).

## Installing
The java files can all be compiled into class files in a bin directory using the Makefile
included with the project with the following command: `make`.

## Running
Once the class files are installed in the bin directory, the project can be run, either using the
[GUI](#gui) or from the [command line](#command-line).

### GUI
To run the GUI version of the project, use the command `java -cp bin voicesplitting.gui.VoiceSplittingGUI`.
An in-depth walkthrough of how to use the GUI can be found in the [GUI Readme](http://apmcleod.github.io/voice-splitting/gui.html).

### Command Line
#### Arguments
To run the project from the command line, use the command

> `java -cp bin voicesplitting.voice.hmm.HmmVoiceSplittingModelTester ARGS Files`

Here, `Files` should be a list of 1 or more MIDI files or directories containing only MIDI
files. Any directories listed will be searched recursively for all files, and if any of the files
found are not in MIDI format, an exception will be thrown.

ARGS:
 * Running arguments:
   * `-r` = Run a test (if used with -t, we will use the tuned parameters instead of any given).
   * `-t [STEPS]` = Tune to maximize F1-Measure, and optionally set the number of steps to make
     within each parameter range to an Integer value (default = 5). It is HIGHLY recommended to use this training
     method rather than your own script because it runs the tests in parallel as much as possible to speed up
     training.
   * `-e` = Extract and print the separated voices.
   * `-v` = Verbose (print out each song and each individual voice when running).
   * `-T` = Use tracks as correct voice (instead of channels). See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
     for more information.
     
If running with `-r`, the following arguments can be used to change the parameter settings from their default
values (those with which we tested the computer generated WTC fugues in the paper):
   * `-b INT` = Set the Beam Size parameter to the value INT (defualt = 25).
   * `-n DOUBLE` = Set the New Voice Probability parameter to the value DOUBLE (defualt = 5E-10).
   * `-h INT` = Set the Pitch History Length parameter to the value INT (defualt = 11).
   * `-g DOUBLE` = Set the Gap Std Micros parameter to the value DOUBLE (defualt = 224000).
   * `-p DOUBLE` = Set the Pitch Std parameter to the value DOUBLE (defualt = 4).
   * `-m DOUBLE` = Set the Min Gap Score parameter to the value DOUBLE (defualt = 7E-5).
   
#### Output
The `-e` output has the following format:

> `songID noteID voiceID onsetTime(microseconds) offsetTime(microseconds) pitch velocity`

The standard (non-verbose) `-r` output has the following format:

> (`b`,`n`,`h`,`g`,`p`,`m`) = V=`Average Voice Consistency` P=`Precision` R=`Recall` F1=`F1-Measure`

Here, the letters within the parentheses on the left represent the settings of the parameters as listed
in the [Arguments](#arguments) section above. The values on the right correspond to the Average Voice Consistency,
Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure, each as an average over all of the songs given in the `Files` argument.
These metrics are defined precicely in the paper.

The verbose `-r` output has the standard output as its final line, and also prints the following for each of the
songs given in the `Files` argument:

> `FileName`  
> `Correct` / `Total` = `Voice Consistency`  
> ...  
> P=`Precision`  
> R=`Recall`  
> F1=`F1-Measure`  

Here, the "`Correct` / `Total` = `Voice Consistency`" line is repeated per voice, and the Voice Consistency
metric is again defined in the paper.

The training output consists of the standard (or verbose) `-r` output for each unique setting of the parameters,
followed by a single line of output of `BEST =` followed by the non-verbose output from the parameter settings
which achieved the greatest F1-Measure.

#### Examples
To tune on the files in the directory "midi" with a step of 7 and print verbose results:
> `java -cp bin voicesplitting.voice.hmm.HmmVoiceSplittingModelTester -t 7 -v midi`

To test on the files in the directory "midi" using all default values except a beam size of 25:
> `java -cp bin voicesplitting.voice.hmm.HmmVoiceSplittingModelTester -r -b 25 midi`

To test on the files in the directory "midi" using the default parameter settings:
> `java -cp bin voicesplitting.voice.hmm.HmmVoiceSplittingModelTester -r midi`


### Troubleshooting
Most Exceptions that occur while running this program should print a useful error message out to
stderr. In general, there are 2 main types of errors:
 * I/O Errors: These indicate that some I/O error occured while trying to read a MIDI file. These
   could indicate that the program does not have read permission on the given file, or that the
   file does not exist. Check for typos in the file names.
 * MIDI errors: These indicate that the MIDI files given are not in a format that can be read
   by Java. There is currently no way to solve this issue besides looking for new MIDI files.

If the results you are getting seem very low, try using the `-T` flag if running from the command line,
or unchecking the `Use Channel` box (and then reloading the file) if using the GUI. Some MIDI files
divide notes into voices by track while others do it by channel. MIDI files created by this software does both.
